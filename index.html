            <p class="description">
              Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most 
              powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, 
              Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the 
              planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the 
              Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.
